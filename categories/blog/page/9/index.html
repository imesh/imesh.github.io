        <p>Microsoft Research has done a great job on Surface Computing during the last four years and the result is Microsoft Surface. It is a new technology which allows users to interact with their digital content in a more different way. As I saw on the official web site it&rsquo;s a touch sensitive 30 inch screen which is mounted to a table, detects different objects once they are placed on. They have used a dot code (like bar code) pasted on the object for the identification. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/microsoft-has-done-a-great-job-on-surface-computing">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Google has acquired FeedBurner. I&rsquo;m not quite sure why some good companies get acquired by some other big companies. May be because a company like Google can provide the features of FeedBurner to a vast majority by integrating those into Google Applications.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>BizCode Application Builder 1.2 (Beta) was just released. Spent around two days on developing the new functionality to map Collection Association/Aggregations in BizCode Application Builder. Earlier versions did not support this functionality. The way Aggregations are mapped in Visual Studio Class Designer is using Collection Associations. For an example if we have an aggregation between class OrderDetails and class Product, an instance of OrderDetails can hold a collection of Product instances. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/bizcode-application-builder-1-2-beta-released">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I accidentally deleted one of my NTFS partitions while deleting an EXT3 partition. What happened was I plugged my USB hard drive to my notebook and deleted an EXT3 partition from the Windows Disk Management. At that moment Windows was assigning drive letters to my potable hard disk. At the end I lost one of my NTFS partitions with the one I deleted. One of my friends suggested me to use On Track Easy Recovery Professional to recover the data I lost. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/recovered-a-deleted-partition">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Microsoft has released a new technology called Silverlight (WPF/E) which is something similar to Macromedia Flash. As they say it supports most of the major web browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari (on Windows and Mac, Why not Linux if it supports Firefox?). I tried some of the samples on msdn and they seems to be working very fast on an average internet connection. Just like Macromedia Flash we need to pre install Silverlight to view web pages that uses it. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/microsoft-silverlight-wpfe-for-web-presentation">&raquo;</a></p>
