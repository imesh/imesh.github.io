        <p>Java Micro Edition (ME) is the Java Specification defined by Sun Microsystems for mobile and embedded devices with limited memory, display and power capacity. Sun only provides a reference implementation for Java ME, therefore third party vendors have implemented Java Runtime Environments (JRE) for different types of devices. I could not find the exact reason for this, but at the early statges of Java ME there had been a JRE release called Personal Java. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/introduction-to-java-micro-edition">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As a result of the National Entrepreneurship Week from 24th to 30th November 2008 in Sri Lanka I got a chance to attend the Seminars and Workshops organized on the second day. According to the schedule the day was started with Employability, this was not an interesting session for me but anyway there were so many undergraduates who were interested in.

        <p>Today I&rsquo;m really glad to announce the first version of ImageGallery, version 1.0 licensed under GNU Lesser GPL. During past few days I spent my spare time playing around with this to make it available for the public. The initial version which was deployed in my photography page was cleaned and converted into an User Control. Now an Image Gallery can be added to an ASP.NET Page with a single line. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/imagegallery-1-0-released">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is another step in ImageGallery. Yesterday I wrote this new feature to view images in a different form, more precisely it is called the Mosaic view. Now the ImageGallery supports to view images in two different forms, the Thumbnail View and Mosaic View. There will be hyperlinks placed on the page to switch between the two different views. Have a look at my photography page. Thumbnail View Mosaic View <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/mosaic-view-in-image-gallery">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was thinking of writting an Image Gallery from some time back to publish my flickr images in my web log. Very recently I found Flickr.NET API which is a free and open source .NET library which provides access to the Flickr API. So have a look at my first attempt of using Flickr.NET in my photography page. It was a really nice experience to develop your own image gallery. The only challenge I had was to come up with a algorithm to implment the navigator. <a class="read-more" href="http://imesh.github.io:80/flickr-image-gallery">&raquo;</a></p>
